            <p>It happened again: A chemistry experiment gone wrong has resulted in the virus that is beginning the Zombie Apocalypse, and it is beginning at UCF. Our campus is being overrun by the living-dead and they are very, very hungry.</p>

            <h4>How do you survive?</h4>
            <p>The two (2) flags attached to your belt represent your life. That's two lives you have to get yourself across campus into the safety zone. We have mapped out the safest path, but you have to move fast. Obstacles may stand in your way and there's a chance zombies have broken through our barricades - stay aware. We have been able to set up a first aid station along the path, if you lose a life it's possible our medics can help.</p>
            <p>Your peers, intuition and agility are all that can help you now. Make it to the safe zone with at least one flag intact and you have survived - if not, you'll be missed.</p>
